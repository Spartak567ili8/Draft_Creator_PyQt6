# Draft Creator made on PyQt6
## U can create and delete and view urs drafts

Thats a Python File, no mobile version, not an .exe file, written on PyQt6 also thats my first file iv uploaded on github 

You need create a folder name:drafts u can change folder name but u also need to change code in line 74:folder_path = 'drafts' 


what I imported into the project:import os
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QPushButton, QLabel, QVBoxLayout, QWidget
import sys
from PyQt6 import QtWidgets, QtGui, QtCore
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import (QApplication, QInputDialog, QDialog,QLineEdit
, QFormLayout, QTextEdit,QDialogButtonBox, QWidget, QHBoxLayout,QPushButton, QVBoxLayout, QMainWindow, QSizePolicy)

import socket
import threading     but not all iv used 

Thats all!
